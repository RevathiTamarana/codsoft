Student Grade Calculator: 

The Student Grade Calculator is a tool designed to assess student performance based on their marks in various subjects. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process involved in calculating total marks, average percentage, and assigning grades.

1. Input Marks
The first step involves collecting data from the user. This is done by asking for the marks obtained in each subject, typically on a scale of 0 to 100. The user can input the marks for a predefined number of subjects, which is determined before the calculation begins.

2. Calculate Total Marks
Once all marks have been inputted, the next step is to calculate the total marks. This is done by summing all the individual marks obtained across all subjects:

Total Marks
=
∑
(
Marks in Subject 1
+
Marks in Subject 2
+
…
+
Marks in Subject N
)
Total Marks=∑(Marks in Subject 1+Marks in Subject 2+…+Marks in Subject N)
3. Calculate Average Percentage
The average percentage is computed by dividing the total marks by the total possible marks (which is the number of subjects multiplied by 100):

Average Percentage
=
(
Total Marks
Total Possible Marks
)
×
100
Average Percentage=( 
Total Possible Marks
Total Marks
​
 )×100
Where:

Total Possible Marks = Number of Subjects × 100
4. Grade Calculation
Based on the average percentage, a grade is assigned according to predefined criteria. The grading system typically categorizes performance as follows:

A+: 90 - 100%
A: 80 - 89%
B: 70 - 79%
C: 60 - 69%
D: 50 - 59%
F: Below 50%
This grading system provides a clear indication of the student's performance level.

5. Display Results
Finally, the results are displayed to the user. This includes:

The total marks obtained.
The calculated average percentage.
The corresponding grade based on the average percentage.
